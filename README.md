#Sunrise Alarm

Sunrise Alarm is an Android app that takes your device's location and uses it to set an alarm that will wake you up at sunrise.

Users can either use their phone's GPS to set their location, or manually enter it (in the form LAT.DD, LONG.DD).

This app does not depend on Google Play, and does not contain ads.

##Disclaimer
The app's calculations assume the user is in ideal conditions. 'Ideal conditions' is defined as:
- The user is at sea level
- The weather at the user's location cooperates (no clouds, fog, etc.)
- The user lives in a flat area (no mountains)

If you satisfy these conditions, the sunrise will be calculated to an accuracy of +/- a couple minutes. Use the offset shifter to correct for your specific conditions.
